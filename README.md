Hi there,
I am a Computer Engineering senior, I like coding things that solve small, little and annoying problems, I also actually like to solve these problems too haha.

I dont really have a preferred language, I will work with whatever is required, but I think for the most part I like java better.

Typescript seems much more cooler nowadays I can say.
